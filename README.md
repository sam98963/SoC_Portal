# Week 7 - Frontend Project - School of Code Application Portal

A front-end only app allowing applicants to keep track of tasks done and to be completed. Implemented our own front-end authentication system, before learning about Auth0, other authentication services or backend.

### Motivation

For this project we were asked to solve a problem that bootcampers face - since we had all been through the application process and experienced loose documentation and confusion. Even within the bootcamp documentation was ofen hard to locate and we still faced the same problem. So a portal to host all this info was an easy choice to make. I implemented the authentication system, as well as setting up the React-router system, helping with the to-do list and writing up mock data to use.

### Lessons learned

- Read into different approaches to simplify functionality and how it will be later implemented into a project.
- Using mock data early in front-end development and structuring it with back-end in mind is a strong approach to tackling front-end first applications.

### Tech Stack

- React
- React-Router
- Html
- Javascript

### Improvements

Considering the stage of the course at which this application was created, I would keep it front-end only and possibly restart if approaching from a full-stack standpoint. Would have benefitted from considering responsive design earlier on, particularly when planning the UI as tidying up afterwards was more challenging. 

### Usage
1. Login with hania, ahiaj, hungv, samw all with the passwords of 1234.
